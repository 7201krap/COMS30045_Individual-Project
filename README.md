## Representations learnt by SGD and Adaptive learning rules
Researched which conditions naturally increase sparsity and selectivity in a neural network. Finding the conditions is closely related to humanâ€™s continual (lifelong) learning. Therefore, this research could provide valuable insights about how human processes information in the brain.

All codes and graphs could be found in 'codes and graphs/summative' folder
